        <h1>Overview Settings</h1>
        <p>Your overview window is the primary interface 
          you use to interact with the environment when 
          you are out in space. It tracks all objects/players 
          in space, what they are, and how far they are from 
          you. The default settings the game provides are 
          adequate, but to improve efficiency and to block out 
          unnecessary information in hectic times of combat, 
          it is a good idea to set up a custom overview, or at 
          least understand overview filters work. To access your 
          overview settings, un-dock into space and press this button 
          at the top left of your overview menu

        <h2>It is recommended you create one tab for each of the following activities: </h2>
        <dl>
          <dt><h3>Travel</h3></dt>
          <dd>filters for all points of interest in space that 
            you are able to warp to. You may wish to create a 
            separate tab for each type of object you can warp for, 
            i.e. one tab for Stations, one tab for System Gates etc. 
            With the Display Tag filter this is not strictly necessary. 
          </dd>
          <dt><h3>PvE</h3></dt>
          <dd>filters out all except hostile enemy NPC. This clears a 
            lot of clutter compared to the default one that the game 
            provides. Additionally, you can add a filter to display 
            other player pilots that are only neutral or hostile, which 
            is important for situational awareness when you are doing 
            PvE in low-security space. and keeping an eye out for when 
            players warp into your anomaly.
          </dd>
          <dt><h3>PvP</h3></dt>
          <dd>filters out all except hostile enemy players. 
            This is self explanatory. If you are flying with us in a 
            PvP roam fleet, you need to have this tab ready for situational 
            assessment and target acquisition.
          </dd>
          <dt><h3>Fleet</h3></dt>
          <dd>filters out all except players in your fleet. 
            Not strictly necessary right now, but will become 
            more important if we begin to run large scale ops 
            that necessitate things like anchoring or warping to 
            other players.
          </dd>
          <dt><h3>Misc</h3></dt>
          <dd>convenience tab for objects that you only occasionally 
            need to interact with. For me this is all shipwrecks and 
            loot-able containers.
          </dd>
          <dt><h3>Friendlies</h3></dt>
          <dd>optional tab for players in corp, in our alliance, 
            or have good standing with us. Not strictly necessary 
            in my opinion as the Fleet tab will cover most situations 
            when you need to interact with other friendly ships.
          </dd>
          <dt><h3>All</h3></dt>
          <dd>optional tab that contains every object. For times where 
            you just can't find something in any of your other tabs.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Below is the current recommended corporation setup for overviews. 
          You may feel free to add more, but please have these tabs 
          configured so our fleet commanders know everyone is on the same 
          page with their overview info. (TODO: CONFIRM WITH OTHER 
          OFFICERS AND LEADERSHIP)

        <h2>Resetting Filters</h2>
        <p>The filter tab on your overview allows you to quickly select 
          one type of object in space and exclude all others. 
          It’s not recommended to use this to filter between friendlies 
          and foes in combat as you may forget what you’re filtering 
          and miss key information because it was not on your overview. 
          However, in some circumstances it is useful to save having to 
          make another overview tab for. The Travel tab for instance, 
          makes great use of this.
